<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Joyce Ann V. Caumban, but you may just call me Joyce. I am a 20-year old college student, currently in my 2nd year of taking the course BS Computer Science.</p>

<h2>My Favorite Computer Science Subject</h2>
<p>I think my favorite Computer Science subject so far would have to be CMSC 130 because I was really interested in learning about the different types of circuits and I also really enjoyed drawing/illustrating them, even if it would be difficult or confusing at times. It was just satisfying for me to be able to look at my final drawing after solving the given problem. It was one of the subjects I looked forward to learning every week.</p>

<h2>My Favorite GE subject</h2>
<p>My favorite GE subject of those that I have taken so far would be STS 1. I really enjoyed this subject because I learned not only about Science, but also how Science related to different fields such as the arts. It gave me a broader persepctive on the relationship of the two, ad how these heavily influenced our culture and basically how we live now. I also enjoyed researching about different topics that are relevant to the current happenings in the country, and sharing the information that I know to the class.</p>

<h2>My Favorite Programming Language</h2>
<p>I think it would be coding in C. It's not so much a favorite programming language, but more of I got used to coding in C as compared to coding in other programming languages. If I were to choose what programming language I enjoyed the most, though, I think it would be Python because I really enjoyed the project I did back in CMSC 12. I was able to code the four and five in a row game in the terminal, and it was really fun and satisfying afterwards.</p>

<h2>Favorite Food</h2>
<p>My favorite food would have to be pork sinigang, specifically the one that my mom cooks. Homecooked food just hits different, and sinigang would my go-to especially on a rainy day.</p>
